Final project for 6.437(Inference and Information)

This is an implementation of the Metropolis Hastings Algorithm with a few enhancements to decode a Caesar cipher (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

The file function decode in the file decode.py takes a text ciphered and an output file where the actual text will be written.
